## 👨🏽‍💻 Confuse-Trackers
⚠️ __This program searches google and visits websites randomly to make it really hard to track you and fingerprint you.__

⚠️ __This program will / will not confuse trackers with advanced technology we see these days.__

⚠️ __This is a just first step and a research project and a tiny little contribution to the Internet Privacy Movement.__

__When you add new searches and websites to ```searches.txt``` and ```websites.txt``` the program automatically downloads the latest searches and websites you added to every single user who uses it.__

## 👨🏽‍💻 Confuse-Trackers-1.0 - C++

## 👨🏽‍💻 Confuse-Trackers-2.0 - C/C++ (Flash to a Digistump Attiny85)
⚙️ 1. Add your searches list to ```searches.txt```.

⚙️ 2. When you add searches be careful about how many lines you add. Attiny85 can only hold approx. 50 lines.

⚙️ 3. Don't mess with ```incode.txt``` if you don't 100% know what you're changing.

⚙️ 4. Use ```finalize.cpp``` to output the final code to ```finalcode.txt```.

⚙️ 5. If you want to use our latest ```searches.txt```'s keywords, select that option when you use ```finalize.cpp```.

⚙️ 6. After you get the final code, install __Digistump__ drivers and libraries (Search YouTube if you don't know).

⚙️ 7. Flash your code to a Attiny85 or some other compatible board, and use.
