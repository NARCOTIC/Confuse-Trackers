## Confuse-Trackers
This program searches google and visits websites randomly to make it really hard to track you and fingerprint you.

## 👨🏽‍💻 Confuse-Trackers-1.0 - C++
1. In ```settings.txt``` you can change ```line 3``` with your browser name (```chrome```, ```firefox```, etc.)
2. Add your searches list to ```searches.txt``` (Do not exceed 1000 lines).
3. Add your websites list to ```websites.txt``` (Do not exceed 1000 lines).
4. Compile and use.

## 👨🏽‍💻 Confuse-Trackers-2.0 - C/C++ (Flash to a Digistump Attiny85)
1. Add your searches list to ```searches.txt```.
2. When you add searches be careful about how many lines you add. Attiny85 can only hold approx. 50 lines.
3. Don't mess with ```incode.txt``` if you don't 100% know what you're changing.
4. Use ```finalize.cpp``` to output the final code to ```finalcode.txt```.
5. If you want to use our latest ```searches.txt```'s keywords, select that option when you use ```finalize.cpp```.
6. After you get the final code, install __Digistump__ drivers and libraries (Search YouTube if you don't know).
7. Flash your code to a Attiny85 or some other compatible board, and use.

##### ADD YOUR SEARCHES AND WEBSITES
When you add new searches and websites to ```searches.txt``` and ```websites.txt``` the program automatically downloads the latest searches and websites you added to every single user who uses it.
