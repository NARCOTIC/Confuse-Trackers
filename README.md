## Confuse-Trackers
This C++ program searches google and visits websites randomly to make it really hard to track you and fingerprint you.

## Config
1. In ```settings.txt``` you can change ```line 3``` with your browser name (```chrome```, ```firefox```, etc.)
2. Add your searches list to ```searches.txt``` (Do not exceed 1000 lines).
3. Add your websites list to ```websites.txt``` (Do not exceed 1000 lines).

##### üë®‚Äçüíª ADD YOUR SEARCHES AND WEBSITES
When you add new searches and websites to ```searches.txt``` and ```websites.txt``` the program automatically downloads the latest searches and websites you added to every single user who uses it.
